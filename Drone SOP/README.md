# ASR-D501 YOLO Drone Demo

**Real-time object detection controlling drone motors using CPU and NPU inference on the Qualcomm QCS6490.**

Built for Japan IT Week 2026 at the Advantech booth to demonstrate the difference between running YOLOv8 on a general-purpose CPU versus the integrated Hexagon NPU.

---

> **⚠️ SAFETY WARNING**
>
> This is a **stationary demonstration only**. The drone does not fly. **Remove all propellers before running any script.** The motors spin to demonstrate that AI detection controls physical actuators - they are not configured for flight. Actual flight-capable scripts with proper safety checks, failsafes, and GPS/altitude hold are not included and would need to be developed separately.

---

## What It Does

A camera watches the scene. When the YOLOv8 model detects a **clock**, the drone motors speed up. Move the clock left or right and the drone yaws to follow. Remove the clock and the motors drop back to idle.

Two versions of the same demo:
- **CPU version** - YOLOv8n runs on the ARM Cortex-A78 cores (1.3 FPS, 600-700ms latency)
- **NPU version** - YOLOv8n runs on the Hexagon HTP NPU (110.3 FPS, real-time response)

Same model, same camera, same drone. The only difference is where the inference runs.

## Quick Start

> Full step-by-step instructions: **[SETUP-GUIDE.md](SETUP-GUIDE.md)**

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start MAVROS
ros2 launch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=/dev/ttyACM0:115200

# Terminal 2 - Run the demo
cd scripts/

# CPU version (AnkerWork camera):
python3 ankerCAM_cpu_demo.py

# NPU version (AnkerWork camera):
python3 ankerCAM_npu_demo.py
```

Point the camera at a clock. Motors react.

## Model Quantization

The NPU requires a quantized TFLite model. The original YOLOv8n PyTorch model (.pt) is converted through:

```
.pt (PyTorch) → ONNX → .tflite (INT8 quantized for Hexagon HTP)
```

Follow the Advantech quantization guide:
https://github.com/ADVANTECH-Corp/EdgeAI_Workflow/blob/main/ai_system/qualcomm/aom-dk2721/linux/object_detection_demo-using-qc_ai_hub.md

> **Note:** The shell scripts in that guide are written for Yocto Linux with a MIPI camera. If you are running Ubuntu with a USB camera (AnkerWork or RealSense), use the adapted shell scripts in `scripts/` instead. See [NPU Deployment Guide](docs/NPU-deployment-guide.md) for details on what changed and why.

## Available Models

Pre-quantized INT8 TFLite models for the Hexagon NPU are included in the `model/` directory:

| File | Architecture | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `yolov8n_det.tflite` | YOLOv8 nano | 3.3 MB |
| `yolov8s_det.tflite` | YOLOv8 small | 11.0 MB |
| `yolov8m_det.tflite` | YOLOv8 medium | 25.2 MB |
| `yolov8l_det.tflite` | YOLOv8 large | 42.4 MB |
| `yolov8x_det.tflite` | YOLOv8 extra-large | 67.5 MB |
| `yolov11n_det.tflite` | YOLOv11 nano | 2.8 MB |
| `yolov11s_det.tflite` | YOLOv11 small | 9.5 MB |
| `yolov11m_det.tflite` | YOLOv11 medium | 20.3 MB |

The default is `yolov8n_det.tflite`. To use a different model, change the `MODEL_FILE` variable at the top of any NPU script:

```python
MODEL_FILE = "yolov8s_det.tflite"  # ← change this
```

Then copy the model to the scripts directory:

```bash
cp model/yolov8s_det.tflite ~/ai-hub/EdgeAI_Workflow/ai_system/qualcomm/aom-dk2721/linux/script/
```

## Measured Performance

| Metric | CPU | NPU |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Inference FPS | ~1.3 | ~110.3 |
| Board power draw | ~8.5W | ~7.6W |
| Response latency | ~600-700ms (noticeable) | ~25ms (instant) |
| Model size | ~12 MB (FP32) | ~3.3 MB (INT8) |

Idle board power: 5.8W. Board maximum rated: 11W.

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on the ASR-D501
- ROS 2 Jazzy + MAVROS installed ([installation guide](docs/ROS2-and-MAVROS-install.md))
- Pixhawk flight controller with ArduCopter firmware
- Camera connected via USB

---

## Camera Support

| Camera | Format | Device | Decode Stage |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| AnkerWork C310 | MJPEG | `/dev/video2` | jpegparse → jpegdec → videoconvert |
| Intel RealSense D435i | YUYV | `/dev/video6` (RGB) | videoconvert only |

Both cameras produce NV12 after conversion. The NPU inference path is identical from that point on.

To find the correct device for the RealSense:
```bash
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/videoN --list-formats-ext  # look for YUYV
```

| RC_OVERRIDE_TIME | 3 | RC override timeout (seconds) |
| ARMING_CHECK | 0 | Disable pre-arm safety checks |
| FS_THR_ENABLE | 0 | Disable throttle failsafe |
